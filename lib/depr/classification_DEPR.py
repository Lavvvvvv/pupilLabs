    """I-VT velocity algorithm from Salvucci & Goldberg (2000).
    
    One of several algorithms proposed in Salvucci & Goldberg (2000),
    the I-VT algorithm classifies samples as saccades if their rate of
    change from a previous sample exceeds a certain threshold. I-VT 
    can separate between the following classes:
    ```
    Fixation, Saccade

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array of float
        A 1D-array representing the x-axis of your gaze data.
    y : array of float
        A 1D-array representing the y-axis of your gaze data.
    time : float or array of float
        Either a 1D-array representing the sampling times of the gaze 
        arrays or a float/int that represents the sampling rate.
    threshold : float
        The maximally allowed velocity after which a sample should be 
        classified as "Saccade". Threshold can be interpreted as
        `gaze_units/s`, with `gaze_units` being the spatial unit of 
        your eyetracking data (e.g. pixels, cm, degrees). If `None`,
        `mad_velocity_thresh` is used to determine a threshold.
        Default=`None`.
    return_discrete : bool
        If True, returns the output in discrete format, if False, in
        continuous format (matching the gaze array). Default=False.
        
    Returns
    -------
    segments : array of (int, float)
        Either the event indices (continuous format) or the event 
        times (discrete format), indicating the start of a new segment.
    classes : array of str
        The predicted class corresponding to each element in `segments`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array of float
        A 1D-array representing the x-axis of your gaze data.
    y : array of float
        A 1D-array representing the y-axis of your gaze data.
    time : float or array of float
        Either a 1D-array representing the sampling times of the gaze 
        arrays or a float/int that represents the sampling rate.
    th_0 : float
        The initial threshold used at start. Threshold can be interpreted 
        as `gaze_units/s`, with `gaze_units` being the spatial unit of 
        your eyetracking data (e.g. pixels, cm, degrees). Defaults to 200.
    return_past_thresholds : bool
        Whether to additionally return a list of all thresholds used 
        during iteration. Defaults do False.
        
    Returns
    -------
    threshold : float
        The maximally allowed velocity after which a sample should be 
        classified as "Saccade". Threshold can be interpreted as
        `gaze_units/ms`, with `gaze_units` being the spatial unit of 
        your eyetracking data (e.g. pixels, cm, degrees).
    past_thresholds : list of float
        A list of all thresholds used during iteration. Only returned
        if `return_past_thresholds` is True.
